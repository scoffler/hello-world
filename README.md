# hello-world

Hi everyone! I am a second year PhD student in the Systems, Synthetic, and Physical Biology program at Rice University. I am currently working on a magneto genetics project in Jacob Robinson's neuroengineering lab. I enjoy cold brew, walks with my dog Soul, and learning more about the world we live in.
